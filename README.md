Piano Cards is an open-source web-based game that randomly generates a sequence of black and white "cards" representing piano keys. The player is presented with cards in a random black/white pattern, and the goal is to visually engage with the pattern. This could be used as a training tool for developing a quick association between visual patterns and keys, or for fun visual learning games.

## üéÆ Game Description

In **Piano Cards**, each "card" is represented by a color:
- **Black cards** represent black piano keys.
- **White cards** represent white piano keys.

Upon entering the game, the player can select the number of cards they want to generate. The server will return a random sequence of black and white cards, displayed on the screen as clickable or interactive elements.

## üõ† Features and How to Play

1. **Card Generation**: Enter the number of cards you want to generate and click "Roll".
2. **Visual Pattern Display**: Black cards and white cards are displayed in a flexible, responsive grid.
3. **Resizable Interface**: The card container is dynamically sized to fit your screen.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `cards.py`: Main Flask application that handles routing and random card generation.
- `templates/index.html`: Frontend interface where cards are displayed.
- `static/style.css`: CSS for styling the card container and cards.
- `static/cardgen.js`: JS for frontend handling of cards and user input.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for easy installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Server Settings**: Runs on port `18093` locally using the Waitress server for production-grade performance.
- **Customizable Display**: Edit `static/style.css` to change card size, colors, and spacing.

## üìù Notes

- **Requirements**: Works best on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter errors, confirm Python and Flask are installed and configured correctly.
- **Development Mode**: Run with `app.run(debug=True)` in `app.py` for debugging (not recommended for production).
